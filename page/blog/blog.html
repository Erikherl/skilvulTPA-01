        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>Most of people that want to learn fast is by watching tutorials or youtube.
                For me, i highly recommended do not do that, unless it is emergency that
                you require to finish the project or the program in short of amount time.
                For the rest of that, you can follow what i do (this is for suggestion, 
                you can take it or leave it).
            </p>

            <p>As you can see, coding is more like mathematic. It's more logical than 
                memorize things. What you need to do is more to the practice, the more
                action you do, the better your understanding of what language you study.
                For example, in case you learning from youtube and tutorials, you follow it
                step by step and eventually you got what you want. And... that's it, nothing
                more and there's no more goals. The downside of this, it is you will only
                learn one simple application, that only can be used if the case is same. If
                the case change little bit, there's a higher chance you will not understand
                how to solve, and improvised with your code.
            </p>
            <p>In other hand, if you learning by reading some documentation and follow up
                your tutorial video, it will be much different. By doing so, you will be
                curious about some other things that in tutorial not taught. For example,
                in the video is about javascript DOM which is have a lot of syntax and method in it.
                Since you learning too outside of it, you wondering about DOM in other side of hand,
                you actually find something short or there's a shortcut code rather than in video.
                In the end of it, you eventually will learn by yourself and not watching some tutorial
                anymore, you will get used to individually code yourself and find the solution by practice.
                This is the best way to start your coding and be adaptive to it. There's no problem with
                watching some youtube tutorials, it is very fine, but don't get in the hole too deep.

        <button class="collapsible">What next thing to do after i learn all the basic?</button>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>You feel there's nothing more that i can do to learn or expand things in my code. I am stuck
                to improve and confused where i need to go since there's many framework or library or even
                language that i've already seen but it's not what i wanted. In this case, you probably easily
                statisfied and not engage any challenge that many many competition out there held every years.
            </p>
            <img src="../../assets/blog/LearningCode2.png"/>
            <p>If you feel like that one before, don't be. Because what you learn in college, school or
                tutorials is only small part of big coding you only see. There's lot of talented out there
                and they still curious and hungry about their knowledge about code. They know where to learn
                their gap of knowledge. In here i will share some information that might give the insight about
                what we can do if we reach our level 1 learning basic code in language that you currently
                study.
            </p>
            <p>First of all, learning in college, school, or youtube is very small compare to the big one.
                There's a lot of hackathon, competition, and logical algorithm that being held over a years.
                It is about competition about around world or local to be the best among the best code player.
                Usually the competition held only for student that currently enroll, and there's a top their
                that held for general (student and worker) which is there will be profesional that already know
                or the master that answer in stack overflow. What i want to say is, engage this kind of things,
                there's lot to explore out there, we can start by challenge ourself to do better than our previous
                version. And of course don't just joining the event, but you need to practice, practice, and practice.
                World has changed now, any information now is easily to get, so why don't you improve yourself
                before other take your place!

        <button class="collapsible">Tips for boosting your code</button>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>Lastly, i want to share more about tips that can help you learn or improving yourself.
                You can pick one or more or leave it since this is only my tips that can be hopefully
                help yourself to get through to learn coding. 
            </p>
            <img src="../../assets/blog/LearningCode3.jpg"/>
            <p>So, what you need to do is go learn some "Clean Code" that you can read in online or
                purchase one for yourself. This book really help me and others to maintain their to
                be good, neat, and ready to be approved in production without single scratch. This book
                give you insight about how to name your variabel, or class, or function that many people
                can understand whoever read your program. Not only that, there's more into it, about
                more understanding of your program environment, how to use third party tools like library
                outside of your framework use, etc. This book have a lot of pages that can be use as reference
                and it is up to us to use this as our guidance or not. For myself, i only took some of it
                and the rest is kinda more about feeling to use it or not, because eventually code/program
                is like a writer, it's expression from your mind into program.
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, if you want to make sure you got what you need. There's many documentation in every
                language. For example in react, you can access it's documentation in their official website,
                not only in react website, w3school there help you for more about the syntax, and how to use it.
                And there's community that can help you solve the problem and we already know it, stackoverflow.
                So, don't get yourself doubt, internet there will help you. So, happy coding~
